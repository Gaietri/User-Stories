User Story 1: Salesforce User Access Management

Title: Manage Salesforce User Access

Story:
As a Salesforce administrator, I want to efficiently manage user access to ensure that only authorized personnel can view and modify data within Salesforce.

Acceptance Criteria:

User Roles and Profiles:
I can create and assign different roles and profiles for users based on their responsibilities.
Access permissions are defined clearly for each profile to align with the principle of least privilege.

User Creation and Deactivation:
I can easily create new user accounts with the necessary permissions.
Deactivating a user account should promptly revoke their access to Salesforce.

Password Policies:
Password policies are enforced to ensure secure access.
Users are prompted to change their passwords at regular intervals.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
I can enable Two-Factor Authentication for users handling sensitive data.
Users are guided through the 2FA setup process for enhanced security.

User Story 2: Data Migration and Integration

Title: Migrate and Integrate Data into Salesforce

Story:
As a data migration specialist, I want to seamlessly migrate existing data into Salesforce and integrate Salesforce with other systems to ensure data consistency across the organization.

Acceptance Criteria:

Data Import Tool:
A user-friendly data import tool is available to facilitate the migration of bulk data into Salesforce.
The tool supports various file formats and validates data integrity during the import process.

Data Mapping and Transformation:
I can map fields from the source system to corresponding fields in Salesforce.
Data transformation rules are applied during migration to ensure compatibility.

Real-Time Integration:
Salesforce is integrated with other essential systems (e.g., ERP, Marketing) to enable real-time data synchronization.
Changes in Salesforce are reflected immediately in connected systems and vice versa.

Data Quality Checks:
Automated data quality checks are implemented to identify and address data inconsistencies.
Exception reports are generated for any data issues encountered during migration or integration.

Title: Customize Salesforce to Support Workflows

Story:
As a Salesforce administrator, I want to customize the Salesforce environment to align with our organization's workflows and automate routine processes.

Custom Fields and Objects:
I can add custom fields and objects to Salesforce to capture organization-specific data.
The custom fields support various data types and validation rules.

Workflow Rules:
I can create workflow rules to automate standard internal processes to save time and reduce manual errors.
Workflows include triggers, field updates, and email alerts based on predefined conditions.

Approval Processes:
Approval processes are set up for key activities such as opportunity approval or document review.
Approvers receive notifications and can approve or reject directly within Salesforce.

Custom Reports and Dashboards:
Custom reports and dashboards are created to provide real-time insights into organizational performance.
Users can customize their own dashboards based on their roles and responsibilities.
