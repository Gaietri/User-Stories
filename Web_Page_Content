Feature: Interactive Sliding Block on Marketing Website Landing Page

  As a Marketing Strategist,
  I want to display modified existing elements in the marketing website landing page in an interactive sliding block (carousel scroll),
  So that I can bring better interaction to the company's marketing page.

  Scenario: Display modified elements in an interactive sliding block

    Given the marketing website landing page is loaded
    When I view the marketing website landing page
    Then I should see an interactive sliding block with at least three different elements

    Given I can manually navigate through the elements using left and right controls
    When the sliding block automatically rotates elements with a 5-second interval
    Then each element transition should have a visually appealing animation

    Given the sliding block is responsive and functions on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
    When elements within the sliding block are easily modifiable by content administrators
    Then there should be a clear indicator showing the current and total elements

    Given automatic rotation pauses when I interact with it and resumes afterward
    When the sliding block is accessible and complies with WCAG standards
    Then it loads quickly for optimal performance

    Given it functions consistently across major web browsers
    When A/B testing is considered to assess user engagement
    Then clear documentation is provided for updating content within the sliding block

    Given the sliding block is thoroughly tested to ensure smooth and error-free interactions
    When I interact with the sliding block elements
    Then the user story is complete

  Scenario: User Manual Navigation

    Given the marketing website landing page is loaded
    When I view the marketing website landing page
    Then I should see an interactive sliding block with at least three different elements

    When I click the left navigation control
    Then the sliding block should display the previous element

    When I click the right navigation control
    Then the sliding block should display the next element

  Scenario: Automatic Rotation

    Given the marketing website landing page is loaded
    When I view the marketing website landing page
    Then I should see an interactive sliding block with at least three different elements

    Then the elements should smoothly transition to the next element after 5 seconds

    When I interact with the sliding block while it's rotating
    Then the automatic rotation should pause, and I should be able to manually navigate

  Scenario: Mobile Responsiveness

    Given the marketing website landing page is loaded on a mobile device
    When I view the marketing website landing page
    Then I should see an interactive sliding block with at least three different elements

    When I swipe left or right on the mobile device
    Then the sliding block should respond to the swipe gestures

  Scenario: Content Modification

    Given the marketing website landing page is loaded
    When I view the marketing website landing page
    Then I should see an interactive sliding block with at least three different elements

    Given elements within the sliding block are easily modifiable by content administrators
    When a content administrator updates an element
    Then the sliding block should reflect the updated content

  Scenario: Accessibility

    Given the marketing website landing page is loaded
    When I view the marketing website landing page
    Then I should see an interactive sliding block with at least three different elements

    When I use a screen reader or keyboard navigation
    Then I should be able to access and interact with the sliding block elements

    When I run an accessibility audit
    Then the sliding block should meet WCAG standards

  Scenario: Cross-Browser Compatibility

    Given the marketing website landing page is loaded
    When I view the marketing website landing page in various web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
    Then the sliding block should function consistently in all tested browsers
